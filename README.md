## Description

`gpt-llama.cpp` is an API wrapper around [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). It runs a local API server that simulates OpenAI's API GPT endpoints but uses local llama-based models to process requests.

It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for GPT-based applications, meaning that any apps created for use with GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 can work with [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) instead.

The purpose is to enable GPT-powered apps without relying on OpenAI's GPT endpoint and use local models, which decreases cost (free) and ensures privacy (local only).

### Tested platforms

- [x] macOS (ARM)
- [x] macOS (Intel)
- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux (Port :443 blocked by default, may have to change the port to 8000 to get working)

## Features

`gpt-llama.cpp` provides the following features:

- Drop-in replacement for GPT-based applications
- Interactive mode supported, which means that requests within the same chat context will have blazing-fast responses
- Automatic adoption of new improvements from [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
- Usage of local models for GPT-powered apps
- Support for multiple platforms

## Supported applications

## Quickstart Installation

### Prerequisite

üî¥üî¥ ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP** ‚ö†Ô∏è üî¥üî¥

Setup [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) by following the instructions below. This is based on the [llama.cpp README](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#usage). You may skip if you have `llama.cpp` set up already.

#### Mac
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make

# install Python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```
- Then, download the latest release of llama.cpp [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases)
I do not know if there is a simple way to tell if you should download `avx`, `avx2` or `avx512`, but oldest chip for `avx` and newest chip for `avx512`, so pick the one that you think will work with your machine. (lets try to automate this step into the future)
- Extract the contents of the zip file and copy everything in the folder (which should include `main.exe`) into your llama.cpp folder that you had just cloned. Now back to the command line

``` bash
# install Python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Test llama.cpp
Confirm that `llama.cpp` works by running an example. Replace <YOUR_MODEL_BIN> with your llama model, typically named something like `ggml-model-q4_0.bin`
```bash
# Mac
./main -m models/7B/<YOUR_MODEL_BIN> -p "the sky is"

# Windows
main -m models/7B/<YOUR_MODEL_BIN> -p "the sky is"
```

It'll start spitting random BS, but you're golden if it's responding. You may now move on to 1 of the 2 below methods to get up and running.

### Running gpt-llama.cpp

#### NPM Package

```bash
# run without installing
npx gpt-llama.cpp start

# alternatively, you can install it globally
npm i gpt-llama.cpp -g
gpt-llama.cpp start
```

That's it!


#### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp.git
   cd gpt-llama.cpp
   ```

   - Recommended folder structure
     ```
        documents
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llama.cpp
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models
        ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <YOUR_.BIN_MODEL_FILES_HERE>
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gpt-llama.cpp
     ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server!

   ```bash
   # Basic usage
   npm start 

   # To run on a different port
   # Mac
   PORT=8000 npm start

   # Windows cmd
   set PORT=8000
   npm start

   # Use llama.cpp flags (use it without the "--", so instead of "--mlock" do "mlock")
   npm start mlock threads 8 ctx_size 1000 repeat_penalty 1 lora ../path/lora
   ```

## Quickstart Installation (with docker)

### Prerequisites

Download appropriate llama models, typically named something like `ggml-model-q4_0.bin`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp.git
   ```

2. Build the image:

    ```bash
   cd gpt-llama.cpp
   docker build -t gpt-llama .
    ```

3. Run the image to start the server!

    ```bash
    docker run --name gpt-llama -v <YOUR MODEL DIRECTORY>:/llama.cpp/models -p <YOUR PORT>:443 gpt-llama
    ```

    Replace <YOUR MODEL DIRECTORY> to the directory you placed the downloaded models and replace <YOUR PORT> to the port you want to expose, like 8000.

## Usage

1. To set up the GPT-powered app, there are 2 ways:

   - To use with a documented GPT-powered application, follow [supported applications](https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp#Supported-applications) directions.
   - To use with a undocumented GPT-powered application, please do the following:
     - Update the `openai_api_key` slot in the gpt-powered app to the absolute path of your local llama-based model (i.e. for mac, `"/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Documents/llama.cpp/models/vicuna/7B/ggml-vicuna-7b-4bit-rev1.bin"`). Note that for docker usage, the path should be started with `/llama.cpp/models`, like `"/llama.cpp/models/vicuna/7B/ggml-vicuna-7b-4bit-rev1.bin"`
     - Change the `BASE_URL` for the OpenAi endpoint the app is calling to `localhost:443` or `localhost:443/v1`. This is sometimes provided in the `.env` file, or would require manual updating within the app OpenAi calls depending on the specific application.

2. Open another terminal window and test the installation by running the below script, make sure you have a llama .bin model file ready. Test the server by running the `test-installation` script

   ```bash
   # Mac & Linux
   bash ./test-installation.sh

   # Mac & Linux with docker
   ENV=docker bash ./test-installation.sh
   ```

3. (Optional) Access the Swagger API docs at `http://localhost:443/docs` to test requests using the provided interface. Note that the authentication token needs to be set to the path of your local llama-based model (i.e. for mac, `"/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Documents/llama.cpp/models/vicuna/7B/ggml-vicuna-7b-4bit-rev1.bin"`) for the requests to work properly.
